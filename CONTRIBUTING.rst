Survey
^^^^^^

Please first fill out the VERY brief survey about the consent forms
for your studies: http://goo.gl/forms/2lsmYcOsAs . It has only few
questions and should take only a few minutes to fill out.  Even if
your Consent form doesn't include yet any provision for data sharing
-- your contribution would be very valuable, although would consist of
simply saying "No".

Additional materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please report to `GitHub issues`_ or even send a new pull request via
`GitHub pull requests`_ with

- samples of consent forms allowing re-distribution/deposit to
  public archives

- relevant publications and discussions

- changes/recommendations for the **ultimate** consent form formulation

IRB committee members
---------------------

We would welcome your feedback  very much, in particular

- what concerns on public sharing of neuroimaging data you might have
  if any identifiable information removed (e.g. skull stripped) and
  research participants agreed to those terms?

- what particular consent form composition and wording aspects would
  you recommend? (e.g. "make it an explicit additional form requiring
  a separate signature") and why?


Speaking multiple languages?
----------------------------

Please file an issue on `GitHub Issues`_ mentioning languages you
would like to contribute or help maintain translations for, or simply
propose a PR with the translation. We will be happy for you to join
our Internationalization (`i18n`) teams.


Versioning
----------

All Open Brain Constent (OBC) documents now follow following
versioning schema:

`OBC-<NAME>[.translation] MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- `MAJOR` - boost when introducing major changes
- `MINOR` - any change which might already require translations review/update
- `PATCH` - language-specific minor fixes

Translations must use `MAJOR.MINOR` component from the corresponding
English version of the document.

`.PATCH` is incremented in English version only if change does not
require translations update (e.g., a typo).

`.PATCH` is incremented in translations upon any tune up of
translation from its previous state for the same `MAJOR.MINOR`
version.
